✅ Spoof Bluetooth devices & hijack connections (Hcitool, Btlejack)

✅ Crack Wi-Fi passwords & inject malicious traffic (Aircrack-ng, Wifiphisher)

🛠️ 2. CAN Bus Exploitation

✅ Sniff CAN messages from the infotainment system (CANtact, Kayak)

✅ Perform replay attacks (e.g., inject malicious CAN messages)

✅ Simulate unauthorized access to vehicle controls

🛠️ 3. OTA Firmware & Cloud Security Testing

✅ Extract infotainment firmware using Binwalk & Ghidra

✅ Identify encryption weaknesses in OTA updates
